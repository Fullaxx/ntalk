You may have several problems running ntalk in a terminal emulator under
XWindows. That's because some terminal emulators cannot correctly
cooperate with ncurses library. So, firstly try
to run ntalk under console. If it works try to use
different terminal emulators.

It works very well with - for instance - rxvt and Eterm.
