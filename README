ntalk - Ncurses Talk
====================

 REQUIREMENTS
 This version of ntalk-client requires ntalk-server 1.0.0 or later.
 
 DESCRIPTION
 
 Ntalk is a chat application. Is is designed to be much more
 friendly than Unix talk and provide nice console interface.
 You will need ntalks (ntalk server) to run ntalk. You
 can download it from ntalk homepage (see below).
 I also provide Kntalk, a KDE ntalk client for the X Window
 System. Visit my web page for details.
 
 CONFIGURATION
 
 Ntalk uses .ntalkrc configuration file. If you already used
 ntalk, you can find it in your home directory. Otherwise,
 a sample one is provided with this package. Some options
 are saved by ntalk itself (nick, server address), other
 you have to change by editing your configuration file.
 Option 'body' (value) is placed after the '=' sign. 
 You should not change the data before that sign, because
 ntalk won't be able to read it. But if you do so, it won't
 cause crash (or other problem), the option will be just
 skipped.
