 WARNING: I recived a message, that sometimes ntalk doesn't
 create its configuration file correctly. If you have the
 same problem, create manually a .ntalkrc file in your
 home directory. The file should look like this:
 
 <---cut here--->
 
 # these are comment
 # nickname:
 
 N:ntalker
 
 # server address:
 
 H:127.0.0.1
